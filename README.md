Several directions are pursued in this project:

## Research on vocabulary (receptive versus productive). 

This is split into several tasks:

1. Manual checks of automatic annotation of two corpora: coursebooks (COCTAILL) and essays (SweLL-pilot)

2. Manual checks of SVALex, a sense-based word list generated from COCTAILL corpus

3. (in future: Manual checks of SweLLex, a sense-based word list generated from SweLL-pilot)

4. Manual lexicographic annotation of SVALex (and ev. SweLLex) using LEGATO tool: https://spraakbanken.gu.se/larkalabb/legato 

5. 


## Research on grammar (receptive versus productive)

This is split into several tasks:

1. Passives

2. Prepositions

3. Definiteness

4. Embedded clauses?

5.
